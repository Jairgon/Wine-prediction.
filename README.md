# Wine-prediction.
Here we will use the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. It has separate datasets for red wine and white wine Here, we will combine the datasets to predict the wine quality and whether the wine is red or white solely from the attributes.  we will model wine quality estimations as a regression problem and wine type detection as a binary classification problem.
